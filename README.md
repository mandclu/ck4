# Media Widget

This media widget can embed image, audio, video and iframe elements solely with their corresponding tags (`<img>`, `<audio>`, `<video>` and `<iframe>`) or wrapped within a `<figure class="media">` when used with a caption. 

It also supports alignment by setting an appropriate CSS class (`media-left` or `media-right`) and the attributes `width`, `height` and `alt`. The `controls`(audio and video) and `allowfullscreen` (iframe) are automatically set.

If you have installed a file browser that uses the API of the [mediabrowser add-on](https:://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/mediabrowser) or the [filebrowser add-on](https:://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/filebrowser), the _Browse server_ button will appear. This widget itself does not provide any file browser.

No configuration necessary.
